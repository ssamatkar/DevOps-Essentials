**Create a New Repository**:
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Do not initialize it with a `README.md`, `.gitignore`, or license.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/merge-conflict-demo.git
     cd merge-conflict-demo
     ```

2. **Initialize the Repository Locally**:
   - Initialize the repository with a `main` branch and make the first commit:
     ```bash
     echo "This is the README file." > README.md
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Initial commit on main branch"
     git push -u origin main
     ```

### 2. **Create and Modify Branches**

#### **Create a Feature Branch and Push to GitHub**

1. **Create and switch to a new branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```

2. **Modify the `README.md` file**:
   ```bash
   echo "This is a change in the feature-branch." >> README.md
   ```

3. **Commit the change and push the branch to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Update README on feature-branch"
   git push -u origin feature-branch
   ```

#### **Modify the `main` Branch Locally**

1. **Switch back to the `main` branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Make a conflicting change to the `README.md` file**:
   ```bash
   echo "This is a change in the main branch." >> README.md
   ```

3. **Commit the change and push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Update README on main branch"
   git push origin main
   ```

### 3. **Create the Merge Conflict on GitHub**

#### **Open a Pull Request**

1. **Go to GitHub** and navigate to your repository.
2. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Click on the "Pull requests" tab.
   - Click "New pull request".
   - Compare the `feature-branch` with `main`.
   - Click "Create pull request".

#### **Merge the Pull Request**

1. **Attempt to Merge**:
   - Youâ€™ll see a message saying that the branch has conflicts that must be resolved before merging.
   - Click "Resolve conflicts" to handle the merge conflict directly on GitHub.

2. **Resolve the Conflict**:
   - GitHub will show the conflicting sections of the `README.md` file, similar to how it would appear locally:
     ```plaintext
     This is the README file.
     <<<<<<< main
     This is a change in the main branch.
     =======
     This is a change in the feature-branch.
     >>>>>>> feature-branch
     ```
   - Manually edit the file to resolve the conflict. For example, you might decide to keep both changes:
     ```plaintext
     This is the README file.
     This is a change in the main branch.
     This is a change in the feature-branch.
     ```

3. **Mark as Resolved**:
   - After resolving the conflict, click "Mark as resolved".
   - Commit the merge and complete the pull request.

### 4. **Update Local Repository**

After resolving the conflict on GitHub, you need to update your local repository:

1. **Pull the latest changes from `main`**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
